TLDR; run python main.py after all packages installed and you make a plots dir.

To run this code you will need to install numpy matplotlib bettermdptools

You can use pip or conda or whatever you would like. I just did pip.

Then make a plots directory in the root, very important!

Once you have the correct packages installed and the plots dir, just run python main.py. This will generate ALL the charts and data used in my project write up. It will take a while to complete (20minutes+) If you just want to execute a small portion, you can comment out the method calls at the very bottom of main.py.

a few notes: -Nothing says the class name on the github so that it doesn't come up in search results -I am planning to delete the repository after the semester ends -Make sure you have a plots dir -I did this on the linux subsystem on windows (WSL2) -Should in theory work on any linux machine (I did not extensively test this) -Does not require a GPU. -There is no seeding except for frozen lake map generation, therefore not all charts produced will match 100% to the project report -I silenced all warnings on this one

TLDR; run python main.py after all packages installed you make a plots dir.
